SQL Enclave
===========

SQL Enclave is an encrypted data substrate for Swift apps based on SQLite and SQLCipher. It is a cross-platform Darwin (macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS) and Linux SPM module with no external dependencies.

SQLEnclave can be included in your project with:

```swift

```

## Example

### Connecting to an encrypted database

```swift

```

### Changing the key of an encrypted database

```swift

```

### Binding Swift types to database schema

```swift

```

## Provenance

SQL Enclave is mostly a re-packaging of multiple independent projects:

 - [SQLite][] by D. Richard Hipp: the ubiquitous embedded SQL database
 - [SQLCipher][] by : patches to SQLite and [GRDB][] ([contributed by DuckDuckGo](https://github.com/duckduckgo/GRDB.swift)) to integrate the SQLCipher encryption suite
 - [GRDBQuery][] by Gwendal Roué: Swift bindings for SQLite
 - A bit of jiggery-pokery to get Linux passing

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. What cryptography libraries does SQLEnclave use?

SQLCipher (and therefore also SQLEnclave) uses CommonCrypto on Darwin platforms and OpenSSL on Linux to implement cryptography features.

1. Is SQLEnclave compatible with SQLite?

SQLEnclave embeds SQLite itself, and so it can interact seamlessly with `.sqlite3` databases created with other apps. Note, however, that an encrypted enclave will no longer be readable 

1. Can I trust the format of the SQLite database for long-term data storage?

SQLite is one of four formats (along with XML, JSON, and CSV) recommended for [long-term storage of datasets](https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html) by the United States Library of Congress.
